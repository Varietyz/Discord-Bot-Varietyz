## **Server Management Features**

### **For Normal Members**

1. **/profile**  
   **What It Does:**

    - Displays the memberâ€™s registered RSNs, their current rank(s), and some personal statistics (e.g., competition wins, top rankings, recent activity).  
      **Why Itâ€™s Useful:**
    - Provides users with quick insight into their standing and activity without having to dig through external websites.  
      **How It Fits:**
    - It leverages the existing RSN registration and activity data without affecting other modules.

2. **/view_competition**  
   **What It Does:**

    - Shows the current active and upcoming competitions, along with details like metric, start/end times, and leaderboard summaries.  
      **Why Itâ€™s Useful:**
    - Keeps members informed about clan competitions and upcoming events.  
      **How It Fits:**
    - Builds on the existing competition lifecycle and leaderboard embeds; itâ€™s read-only and doesnâ€™t modify data.

3. **/help**  
   **What It Does:**
    - Provides a list of available commands with brief descriptions (possibly with categorized help for members vs. admins).  
      **Why Itâ€™s Useful:**
    - Especially for new members, a comprehensive help command reduces support requests and makes the bot more accessible.  
      **How It Fits:**
    - Itâ€™s independent and pulls data from a central help/documentation module, leaving the core functionality untouched.

---

### **For Administrators (Moderation & Maintenance)**

1. **/kick_inactive**  
   **What It Does:**

    - Identifies and optionally removes clan members who have been inactive for a certain period (based on the activity metrics).  
      **Why Itâ€™s Useful:**
    - Helps maintain an active, engaged clan and automates a common moderation task.  
      **How It Fits:**
    - Leverages the `calculateActivity` data and integrates with Discordâ€™s member management APIs without interfering with other commands.

2. **/update_roles**  
   **What It Does:**

    - Forces a re-synchronization of user roles based on their current in-game achievements.  
      **Why Itâ€™s Useful:**
    - Provides a manual override in case automatic role updates lag or encounter errors.  
      **How It Fits:**
    - Calls the existing role update logic (e.g., from `auto_roles.js` and `member_channel.js`), so itâ€™s an extension rather than a replacement.

3. **/clear_channel**  
   **What It Does:**

    - Clears messages from a specified text channel (similar to the `purgeChannel` utility).  
      **Why Itâ€™s Useful:**
    - Helps moderators keep channels tidy, especially in high-traffic areas like competition announcements or voting channels.  
      **How It Fits:**
    - It uses the existing `purgeChannel` functionality, offering a new command interface for moderation.

4. **/sync_members**  
   **What It Does:**

    - Triggers a manual synchronization of clan member data with the WOM API and the database.  
      **Why Itâ€™s Useful:**
    - Provides an admin tool for quickly resolving data inconsistencies or for troubleshooting sync issues.  
      **How It Fits:**
    - It wraps existing functionality (e.g., parts of `active_members.js` and `player_data_extractor.js`) in an admin command.

5. **/backup_db**  
   **What It Does:**

    - Initiates a backup of the SQLite database, perhaps by copying the file to a backup directory or uploading it to a remote storage service.  
      **Why Itâ€™s Useful:**
    - Regular backups are critical for data integrity and disaster recovery.  
      **How It Fits:**
    - This command is independent and can be implemented as a utility that uses Nodeâ€™s file system APIs without interfering with the current modules.

6. **/migrate_competitions**  
   **What It Does:**

    - Manually triggers the migration process for ended competitions (i.e., moving them from the active table to the ended table).  
      **Why Itâ€™s Useful:**
    - Allows admins to force migrations in case of errors or delays in the automatic process.  
      **How It Fits:**
    - Wraps the existing `migrateEndedCompetitions` script in a command interface, offering manual control.

7. **/view_logs**  
   **What It Does:**
    - Retrieves recent log entries from the logging system, potentially filtered by level (e.g., errors, warnings).  
      **Why Itâ€™s Useful:**
    - Provides a quick way for admins to monitor the botâ€™s health and troubleshoot issues without having direct access to the server logs.  
      **How It Fits:**
    - This can be implemented as a lightweight command that reads from a log file or a logging API, separate from the core bot functionality.

### **Why These Commands Work Well**

- **Centralization and Modularity:**  
  Each suggested command leverages existing functionality or utilities within the project (like the database utilities, rate limiting, or API calls) without altering the core business logic. They are independent and can be integrated into the command framework seamlessly.

- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  Maintenance and moderation commands focus on administrative tasks (syncing data, cleaning channels, backing up the database) while member commands focus on information retrieval (viewing profiles and competitions). This clear separation makes the bot easier to use and manage.

- **Enhancing Functionality:**  
  The suggested commands fill gaps in manual controlâ€”for example, forcing a sync or updating rolesâ€”allowing admins to intervene if automated processes encounter issues.

- **Ease of Integration:**  
  Because my project already uses Discord.js, SQLite, and various utilities, these commands can be implemented using similar patterns to the existing ones. They follow the same async/await and error-handling conventions, ensuring consistency throughout the codebase.

### **Dynamic Resources**

1. **Dynamic Emoji Tag Collection:**
    - Collect all emojis available in the server and make them accessible for bot use.
    - Categorize emojis for use in:
        - Event messages
        - Role reactions
        - Fun and engagement activities

---

## **Background and Maintenance Tasks**

1. **Scheduled Maintenance:**

    - Daily automated cleanup of:
        - Inactive RSNs
        - Outdated event data
    - Optimize the SQLite database periodically to improve performance.

2. **Error Handling Improvements:**
    - Add enhanced error logging for:
        - WoM API request failures
        - Discord rate-limit handling
    - Notify admins in Discord of critical bot issues.

# CLAN CHAT GENERATION

- Generate the Clan Chat channel 'ðŸ’¬clan-chat'
- Generate a webhook url for that channel named 'ðŸ’¬OSRS | Clan Chat'
- Append image from image_cache 'hook_avatars' table under the file_name 'cc_webhook_avatar'
- Send message to channel collected from guild.db channel_key 'channel_staff_chat' informing user of clanchat generation and prompting them with modal to register the cc webhook
    - set modal title to: Register Clanchat Webhook
    - implement fields: secret key, clan name, endpoint url (end point url default = https://clanchat.net)
    - add a message prompting them to click the register webhook button on the message that was sent if the modal gets cancelled, informing them its necessary to register the secret key for guaranteed functionality.
      the embed with the current created webhook and channel with a permanent button to quickly re-open the modal to register it should be sent to the channel in log_channels table under log_key 'critical_alerts'
