/**
 * @fileoverview
 * **Player Activity Data Utilities** ‚è±Ô∏è
 *
 * This module provides functions for managing player activity data in the Varietyz Bot's SQLite database.
 * It ensures the existence of the `active_inactive` table and calculates the number of active and inactive players
 * based on their last recorded progress.
 *
 * **Key Features:**
 * - **Table Management**: Ensures the `active_inactive` table exists, which stores player usernames and their last progress timestamp.
 * - **Active Player Count**: Calculates the number of players who have progressed in the last 7 days.
 * - **Inactive Player Count**: Calculates the number of players who have not progressed in the last 21 days.
 *
 * **External Dependencies:**
 * - **luxon**: For handling date and time operations (e.g., calculating 7-day and 21-day intervals).
 * - **dbUtils**: For executing SQL queries to interact with the SQLite database.
 *
 * @module utils/calculateActivity
