/**
 * @fileoverview
 * **Sleep Utility** ⏳
 *
 * This module provides a utility function for creating delays in execution.
 * It offers a simple, promise-based mechanism to pause asynchronous operations
 * for a specified duration. This is especially useful in async/await workflows to
 * introduce delays without blocking the event loop.
 *
 * **Key Features:**
 * - **Promise-based Delay**: Returns a promise that resolves after the specified time.
 * - **Input Validation**: Validates that the delay duration is a non-negative number.
 * - **Ease of Use**: Simplifies adding delays in asynchronous operations.
 *
 * **External Dependencies:**
 * - None.

/**
 * Pauses execution for a specified number of milliseconds.
 *
 * This function returns a promise that resolves after the specified duration,
 * allowing asynchronous functions to use `await` to introduce a delay.
 *
 * @function sleep
 * @param {number} ms - The number of milliseconds to delay. Must be a non-negative number.
 * @returns {Promise<void>} A promise that resolves after the specified duration.
 * @throws {TypeError} If the provided `ms` is not a number or is negative.
 *
 * @example
 * // Example: Pause execution for 2 seconds.
 * async function example() {
 *     console.log('Start');
 *     await sleep(2000);
 *     console.log('End'); // "End" will log after approximately 2 seconds.
 * }
