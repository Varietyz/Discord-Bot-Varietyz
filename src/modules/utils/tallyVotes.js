/**
 * ðŸŽ¯ **Tallies Votes and Determines the Winning Metric for a Competition**
 *
 * This function tallies votes for a completed competition by querying the database for votes
 * associated with the competition's ID. It groups the votes by the selected metric and counts
 * the number of votes per metric. If there is a tie between metrics with the highest vote count,
 * it randomly selects one of them as the winner.
 *
 * @async
 * @function tallyVotesAndRecordWinner
 * @param {Object} competition - The completed competition object. Must include an `id` and `type` property.
 * @returns {Promise<string|null>} A promise that resolves to the winning metric as a string, or `null` if no votes exist.
 *
 * @example
 * // Example usage:
 * const winningMetric = await tallyVotesAndRecordWinner(competition);
 * if (winningMetric) {
 * console.log(`The winning metric is: ${winningMetric}`);
 * } else {
 * console.log('No votes were recorded for this competition.');
 * }
