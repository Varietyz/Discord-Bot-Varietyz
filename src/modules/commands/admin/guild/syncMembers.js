 * **Sync_members Command** üìã
 *
 * Defines the `/sync_members` slash command for the Varietyz Bot.
 * This command allows administrators to manually synchronize clan members with the Wise Old Man (WOM) API,
 * updating their data and roles. It fetches all distinct user IDs from the `registered_rsn` table,
 * processes each user by calling the `fetchAndProcessMember` function, and returns a summary of the results.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * üîπ **Usage:**
 * - Must be executed by an administrator.
 * - Provides a summary of processed and failed member synchronizations.
 *
 * üîó **External Dependencies:**
 * - **Discord.js**: For handling slash command interactions.
 * - **SQLite**: For querying registered RSN data.
 * - **Wise Old Man API**: For fetching the latest member data.
 * - **Logger**: For logging command activity and errors.

     * Performs the following steps:
     * 1. Defers the reply to allow sufficient processing time.
     * 2. Fetches all distinct user IDs from the `registered_rsn` table.
     * 3. Iterates through each user ID and calls `fetchAndProcessMember` to update their data and roles.
     * 4. Returns a summary message indicating the number of processed and failed members.
