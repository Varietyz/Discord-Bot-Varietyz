/**
 * @fileoverview
 * **Sync_members Command** ðŸ“‹
 *
 * Defines the `/sync_members` slash command for the Varietyz Bot.
 * This command allows administrators to manually synchronize clan members with the Wise Old Man (WOM) API,
 * updating their data and roles. It fetches all distinct user IDs from the `registered_rsn` table,
 * processes each user by calling the `fetchAndProcessMember` function, and returns a summary of the results.
 *
 * **External Dependencies:**
 * - **Discord.js**: For handling slash command interactions.
 * - **SQLite**: For querying registered RSN data.
 * - **Wise Old Man API**: For fetching the latest member data.
 * - **Logger**: For logging command activity and errors.
 *

     * This function performs the following steps:
     * 1. Defers the reply to allow sufficient processing time.
     * 2. Fetches all distinct user IDs from the `registered_rsn` table.
     * 3. Iterates through each user ID and calls `fetchAndProcessMember` to update their data and roles.
     * 4. Returns a summary message indicating the number of processed and failed members.
     *

     * @function execute
     * @param {Discord.CommandInteraction} interaction - The interaction object representing the command.
     * @returns {Promise<void>} Resolves when the command execution is complete.

     * @example
     * // When an administrator runs /sync_members:
     * await execute(interaction);
