 * selects competitions whose end time has passed, inserts them into the ended_competitions table,
 * and then deletes them from the active competitions table.
 *
 * **External Dependencies:**
 * - **SQLite**: For executing SQL queries via the dbUtils module.
 * - **Logger**: For logging migration progress and errors.

/**
 * üéØ Migrates Ended Competitions
 *
 * This asynchronous function migrates competitions that have ended (i.e., where the end time is in the past)
 * from the active competitions table to the ended_competitions table. The process includes:
 * - Ensuring the ended_competitions table exists.
 * - Selecting competitions that have ended based on the current time.
 * - Inserting each ended competition into the ended_competitions table.
 * - Deleting the migrated competition from the active competitions table.
 *
 * @async
 * @function migrateEndedCompetitions
 * @returns {Promise<void>} Resolves when the migration process is complete.
 *
 * @example
 * // Run the migration process:
 * await migrateEndedCompetitions();
