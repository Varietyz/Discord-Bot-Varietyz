 * **Migrate Ended Competitions Script** ‚è≥
 *
 * This script migrates competitions that have ended from the active competitions table
 * to the ended_competitions table in the database. It ensures the ended_competitions table exists,
 * selects competitions whose end time has passed, inserts them into the ended_competitions table,
 * and then deletes them from the active competitions table.
 *

 * üîπ **Usage:**
 * Run this script with:
 * `node migrateEndedCompetitions.js`
 *
 * ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Ensure you have a backup of your database before running migrations.

/**
 * üéØ **Migrates Ended Competitions**
 *
 * This asynchronous function performs the migration of competitions that have ended (i.e., where the end time is in the past)
 * from the active competitions table to the ended_competitions table. The process includes:
 *
 * - Creating the `ended_competitions` table if it doesn't exist.
 * - Selecting competitions from the active table whose `ends_at` is less than the current time.
 * - For each ended competition, inserting it into the `ended_competitions` table and then deleting it from the active table.
 *
 * @async
 * @function migrateEndedCompetitions
 * @returns {Promise<void>} Resolves when the migration process is complete.
 *
 * @example
 * // To run the migration:
 * await migrateEndedCompetitions();
