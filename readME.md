- **Discord.js:** A powerful library that enables easy interaction with Discord's API. It handles everything from sending messages to managing roles and responding to commands.
- **Wise Old Man (WOM) API:** An external service that provides detailed data about OSRS players, including stats, achievements, and activities. **Varietyz Bot** uses this API to fetch and display up-to-date player information.
- **SQLite:** A lightweight, file-based database system used to store and manage clan data, including registered RSNs, member information, and player statistics. SQLite is chosen for its simplicity and efficiency, making it perfect for small to medium-sized applications.
- **Winston Logger:** A versatile logging library that records the bot's activities, errors, and other important events. This aids in monitoring the bot's performance and troubleshooting any issues that arise.

### Background Operations

**Varietyz Bot** operates continuously in the background, performing several key functions to ensure your clan runs smoothly:

1. **Data Fetching:**

    - **RSN Registration:** When a member registers their RSN using the `/rsn` command, the bot sends a request to the WOM API to retrieve the player's data.
    - **Scheduled Updates:** At regular intervals (e.g., daily), the bot fetches updated data for all registered RSNs to keep member information current. This ensures that roles and statuses reflect the latest in-game achievements and activities.

2. **Role Management:**

    - **Automatic Assignments:** Based on the fetched player data, the bot assigns or removes roles according to predefined criteria (e.g., number of boss kills, skill levels).
    - **Activity Tracking:** The bot monitors member activity to categorize them as active or inactive, updating roles and channel names accordingly. This helps maintain an engaged and active clan.

3. **Database Management:**

    - **Storing Data:** All registered RSNs, member roles, and player statistics are stored in the SQLite database. This centralized storage ensures easy access and management of clan data.
    - **Handling Updates:** When a member removes an RSN or changes their name, the bot updates the database to reflect these changes accurately. This keeps the clan roster organized and up-to-date.

4. **Logging:**
    - **Activity Logs:** Every action the bot takes, including role assignments and data updates, is logged for transparency and troubleshooting.
    - **Error Handling:** Any errors encountered during operations are recorded in the logs to facilitate quick resolution and maintain the bot's reliability.

### Data Flow

Understanding the flow of data within **Varietyz Bot** helps in grasping how different components interact:

1. **Member Interaction:**

    - A clan member uses a slash command (e.g., `/rsn`) to register their RSN.
    - The bot processes the command, validates the RSN, and stores it in the SQLite database.

2. **Fetching Data:**

    - The bot sends a request to the WOM API using the provided RSN to retrieve player data.
    - The WOM API responds with detailed statistics, achievements, and activity data.

3. **Processing Data:**

    - The bot analyzes the fetched data to determine appropriate roles based on predefined criteria.
    - It updates the SQLite database with the latest player information to keep records accurate.

4. **Assigning Roles:**

    - Based on the processed data, the bot assigns or removes roles within the Discord server.
    - Roles are visually represented with specific emojis and colors for easy identification and engagement.

5. **Scheduled Updates:**

    - At set intervals, the bot repeats the data fetching and processing steps to ensure all information remains up-to-date.
    - It also handles any new name changes or updates to member activity, maintaining the clan's organizational integrity.

6. **Logging:**

    - All operations, including successful actions and errors, are logged using Winston Logger.
    - Logs are organized systematically (by year and month) for easy access and review, aiding in maintenance and troubleshooting.

### RSN Maintenance in the Database

Maintaining accurate and up-to-date RuneScape Names (RSNs) is crucial for effective clan management. **Varietyz Bot** employs several strategies to ensure RSNs are properly maintained within its database:

1. **Registration and Validation:**

    - When a member registers an RSN using the `/rsn` command, the bot validates the RSN by querying the WOM API.
    - Valid RSNs are stored in the `registered_rsn` table in the SQLite database, linked to the member's Discord user ID.

2. **Handling Multiple RSNs:**

    - Members can register up to three RSNs, allowing them to track multiple in-game accounts.
    - Each RSN is stored separately but associated with the same Discord user, enabling comprehensive tracking and role assignments across all registered accounts.

3. **Updating RSNs:**

    - If a member changes their RSN or wishes to remove an existing one, they can use the `/remove_rsn` command.
    - The bot updates the `registered_rsn` table by removing the specified RSNs and revoking any roles associated with them.
    - This ensures that outdated or incorrect RSNs do not clutter the database or affect role assignments.

4. **Automated Synchronization:**

    - **Varietyz Bot** periodically synchronizes the RSN data with the WOM API to fetch the latest player statistics.
    - This synchronization ensures that any changes in a player's achievements or activity levels are reflected in their roles within the Discord server.

5. **Name Change Monitoring:**

    - The bot continuously monitors for any name changes reported by the WOM API.
    - If a member changes their RSN in the WOM group, the bot updates the `registered_rsn` table accordingly and adjusts roles to match the new RSN.

6. **Conflict Resolution:**

    - In cases where multiple members attempt to register the same RSN or when RSNs are already associated with different users, the bot handles conflicts gracefully by notifying the involved members and preventing duplicate entries.

7. **Data Integrity:**

    - The SQLite database enforces data integrity through constraints and validations, ensuring that each RSN is unique and correctly linked to the appropriate Discord user.
    - Regular database maintenance tasks, such as cleaning up inactive RSNs and archiving old data, are performed to keep the database optimized and efficient.

### Automatic Database Maintenance

To ensure the database remains efficient and up-to-date, **Varietyz Bot** incorporates automatic database maintenance routines:

1. **Scheduled Cleanup:**

    - The bot periodically scans the database to remove RSNs that are no longer active or associated with any clan members.
    - This prevents the accumulation of obsolete data and maintains optimal database performance.

2. **Data Archiving:**

    - Historical data, such as past achievements and role assignments, are archived separately to allow for long-term tracking without bloating the main database.
    - Archiving ensures that the bot can provide detailed historical insights while keeping the primary data streamlined.

3. **Integrity Checks:**

    - Regular integrity checks are performed to identify and rectify any inconsistencies or corrupt entries within the database.
    - Automated scripts verify the consistency of relationships between tables, ensuring that RSNs, clan members, and their associated data remain accurately linked.

4. **Backup Procedures:**

    - Automated backups of the database are created at regular intervals to prevent data loss in case of unforeseen issues.
    - Backups are stored securely and can be restored easily to maintain the continuity of clan management operations.

5. **Performance Optimization:**

    - Indexes and optimized queries are employed to enhance the speed and efficiency of database operations.
    - The bot monitors query performance and adjusts indexing strategies as needed to accommodate the growing size of the clan's data.

By implementing these automatic maintenance strategies, **Varietyz Bot** ensures that the database remains robust, efficient, and reliable, providing a solid foundation for all clan management activities.
